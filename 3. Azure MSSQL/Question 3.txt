Question: How would you optimize a slow-running query in Azure SQL Database? Describe your approach to diagnosing and resolving performance issues.

Answer:
- Azure SQL Database Query Performance Insight tool can be used to identify slow-running queries.
- After identifying the query, the execution plan of the query shall be checked. We can observe that if indexes are missing,
  if existing indexes are used as expected and potential bottlenecks. Also index fragmentation should be checked and indexes should be reorganized if needed.
- After checking the indexes, we should check the query and analyze possible refactoring points like using CTEs, using joins instead of subqueries, etc.
