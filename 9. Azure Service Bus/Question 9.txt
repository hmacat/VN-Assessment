Question: Compare Azure Service Bus with RabbitMQ. In what scenarios would you choose one over the other?

Answer: 
We can compare Azure Service Bus and RabbitMQ as follows:

-> Platform Differences
	- Azure Service Bus is cloud-native and managed by Microsoft. It is also fully integrated with other Azure services. 
	  Scalability and high availability (HA) are managed by the cloud infrastructure. These need to be manually managed in RabbitMQ. 
	  For cloud-native applications, Azure Service Bus might be a better option.
	- RabbitMQ is an open source tool which can be hosted on-premises and also on cloud platform. This will bring more flexibility but also operational costs.
	  If there is already a RabbitMQ infrastructure existing in the organization, and technical support is available to manage the scalability and HA, 
	  then this can be a better choice. It may also have a reduced cost comparing Azure Service Bus.
-> Procotol Support
	- RabbitMQ supports different procotols like MQTT. RabbitMQ can be chosen over Azure Service Bus for different protocol support scenarios.
-> Portability
	- Azure Service Bus is dependent on Azure. If portability is important, a setup with RabbitMQ and Docker can be chosen over Azure Service Bus.
