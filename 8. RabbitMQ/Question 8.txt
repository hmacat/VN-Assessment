Question: How do you ensure reliable message delivery in RabbitMQ? What strategies do you use for error handling and message acknowledgment?

Answer:
- Message Acknowledgment
	Manual acknowledgment can be implemented. Consumers confirm when they process a message. If a consumer disconnects, mesasge will be returned to the queue.
	Negative Acknowledgment can be implemented if a consumer can't handle a message, it can send the message back to the queue to be processed again.

- Durable Queues: Queues can be set as durable so they are persistent after a restart.

- Dead Letter Queues: Failed messages are moved to dead letter exchange. They can be analyzed later to solve the problem. This isolation keeps the system unaffected from failed messages.
