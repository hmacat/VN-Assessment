Question: Explain the new features in .NET Core 8 that are beneficial for a Full Stack Developer. How do these features improve development productivity and application performance?

Answer:

-> Native AOT support for ASP.NET Core
	Native AOT skips the traditional JIT compiler step and creates platform dependent code. 
	With Native AOT support, applications have faster startup time and smaller memory footprints which will bring performance improvements.
-> .NET Aspire
	.NET Aspire is a cloud-ready stack for distributed applications with the following features:
		- Orchestraction management for local development environments
		- Nuget packages for common services like Redis, Azure Service Bus, etc.
		- Development tools and templates for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code which helps developer productivity..
-> Garbage Collection Improvements
	In .NET 8, you can change the memory limit of a service while it's running, which is useful for cloud services that need to adjust resources based on demand. 
	The RefreshMemoryLimit() API helps the garbage collector recognize new memory limits, preventing it from using more memory than allowed when demand drops. 
	This ensures efficient resource use and cost savings with improved performance.
